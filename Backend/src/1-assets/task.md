Home assignment for suitability test for a programmer position

The project should be uploaded to GitHub and a suitable link should be sent to the recruitment department.
There is no need to use a Database, but to manage the data in a file.

A company wants to set up a time clock system using ReactJS, ExpressJS, or NestJS with the following functionality:

1. For the task: The system is supposed to serve employees in Germany, so the current time should be displayed using the API (https://worldtimeapi.org/) and managed according to this clock.

2. Upon entering the system, users must authenticate with a username and password (admin, user1, or user2).

3. Regular users will be able to update their check-in or check-out time similar to a standard time clock.

4. Admin users will be able to view the time updates of users with the ability to edit (change) the users' reports.

5. It is possible and recommended to add relevant functionality freely.

Good luck!
